## Task 1: [Base64](https://github.com/iljaSL/tryHackMe-rooms/tree/main/Scripting/Base64)

* The file b64.txt has been base64 encoded 50 times - write a script to retrieve the flag. Try do this in both Bash and Python!

I wrote both the [python](https://github.com/iljaSL/tryHackMe-rooms/blob/main/Scripting/Base64/decoder.py) and the [bash](https://github.com/iljaSL/tryHackMe-rooms/blob/main/Scripting/Base64/decoder.sh) script. Excuting the scripts result in the following answer <br>

Task 1 Flag: `HackBack2019`

#### How to run the scripts
Python: `python3 decoder.py b64.txt`<br>
Bash: `./decoder.sh`

## Task 2: [Gotta Catch em All]()

## Task 3: [Encrypted Server Chit Chat]()
